This unity game was created in 48 hours for a university project, the models were either purchased or freeware.
Using playmaker I was able to code a working AI for the dinosaurs. They have a radar which allows for them to detect if anything is in their field of view and then pursue them. They also wonder around the map and stop periodically and then continue in a random direction. There's a basic set of animations for the raptors and sound effects.
